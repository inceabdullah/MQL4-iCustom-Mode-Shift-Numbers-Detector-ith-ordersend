[But in this video](https://youtu.be/t7Cahg82DPo) I have tried lots of indicators if it is for good for us and improve our badges or not.



Our preveous code is for detecting just shift and mode for iCustom function. But this is for detecting and seeing if it is profitable or not.



In some cases,because of error of mode number for buy or sell signal triggers the opposite order.
